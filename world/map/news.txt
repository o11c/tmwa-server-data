##0 Two announcements to make:
##0 
##0 It seems Tulimshar is finally recovering from the impacts
##0 of the great earthquake.
##0 Although the eastern half of the city is still closed, it
##0 has become much more lively, with children playing between
##0 the houses, farmers going back to their fields, reports of
##0 increased trade activity.
##0 
##0 Surely there are lots of tasks for a young adventurer!
##0

##0 Three pieces of news today.
##0 
##0 First, Mana 0.6.0 got released today. You can find it at 
##3 http://manasource.org##0, or wait for your distribution.
##0 
##0 Second, we will be completely dropping support for the old
##0 TMW 0.0.29.1 client soon - unless there is further reason
##0 for delay, in April 2012.
##0 
##0 Finally, there will be a purge of accounts that have not
##0 been used for over a year. This should help responsiveness
##0 when logging in and choosing a character.

##0 near the woods west of town.
##0 They came from their village high up in the northern snow
##0 mountains.
##0 What might have caused them to leave their hunting grounds
##0 and come down to Nivalis?

##3 A Rule Correction on "No Botting"
##3 
##3 Previously, only activity while the user was away from the
##3 keyboard was a bannable offense.
##3 Now, any sort of automated following (especially, but not
##3 only, attack-following) is also covered.
##3 
##3 If you know any of the people who left this game due to
##3 the prevalence of bots that were previously tolerated,
##3 please tell them it's time to return.
